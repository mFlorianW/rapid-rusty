/// Sends a quit signal to a running module and waits for it to stop gracefully.
///
/// This function publishes a [`QuitEvent`](EventKind::QuitEvent) through the given [`EventBus`],
/// signaling the target module to terminate. It then waits asynchronously for the module’s task
/// (represented by the provided [`tokio::task::JoinHandle`]) to complete within a fixed timeout.
///
/// If the module fails to terminate within the timeout duration, the function will panic with
/// an error message, indicating that the module did not handle the quit event properly.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `event_bus` – A reference to the [`EventBus`] used to send the quit event.
/// * `handle` – A mutable reference to the [`JoinHandle`] of the running module’s asynchronous task.
///
/// # Panics
/// This function panics if:
/// - The module does not stop within the specified timeout duration.
/// - The task returns an error (`Err(())`).
///
/// # Behavior
/// 1. Sends a `QuitEvent` through the event bus.
/// 2. Waits up to `TIMEOUT_MS` milliseconds for the module’s task to finish.
/// 3. If the task completes successfully, the function returns normally.
/// 4. If the timeout expires or the task fails, the function panics.
///
/// # Async
/// This function is asynchronous and must be awaited.

///
/// This function repeatedly polls the provided broadcast receiver for incoming
/// [`Event`] messages, checking if any match the expected [`EventKind`]
/// discriminant. The total waiting time is divided into small polling steps
/// (each one-tenth of the total duration), allowing intermediate timeouts so the
/// function remains responsive.
///
/// If a matching event is received before the timeout expires, it is returned.
/// Otherwise, the function panics after the duration elapses.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `rx` — A mutable reference to a [`tokio::sync::broadcast::Receiver<Event>`]
///   from which events are received.
/// * `duration` — The maximum amount of time to wait for the expected event.
/// * `exp_event` — The expected event type, represented as a
///   [`std::mem::Discriminant<EventKind>`]. Only the variant type is compared;
///   payload data is ignored.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function panics if no matching event is received within the specified
/// `duration`.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns the first [`Event`] whose [`EventKind`] discriminant matches
