/// and collects references to tracks that are within the given detection radius.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `tracks`: A reference to a vector of `Track` instances to check.
/// - `pos`: The `Position` from which distances are measured.
/// - `detection_radius`: The maximum distance (in meters) between `pos` and a track’s start line to consider it detected.
///
/// # Returns
/// A vector containing references to tracks whose start line is within the specified detection radius.

/// Calculates the approximate distance in meters between two geographic positions.
///
/// This function uses a simplified equirectangular approximation to determine  
/// the distance between two latitude/longitude points. It assumes that the  
/// Earth's surface is locally flat and therefore does not account for  
/// large-scale curvature or ellipsoidal effects, making it suitable only  
/// for relatively short distances.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `pos1`: Reference to the first geographic position.
/// - `pos2`: Reference to the second geographic position.
///
/// # Returns
/// The calculated distance between `pos1` and `pos2` in meters as a `f64`.
///
/// # Notes
/// - The function expects latitude and longitude values in **degrees**.
/// - Accuracy decreases over long distances or near the poles.
/// - This method is more efficient than more precise formulas (e.g., Haversine)  
///   but trades some accuracy for performance.
